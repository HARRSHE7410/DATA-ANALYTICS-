This task focuses on building a clean SQL-driven data analysis workflow and then using Python to explore and visualize the results. 
The goal wasn’t just to run queries, but to actually understand the data, validate it, and present meaningful insights in a structured way.

1.Created a sales_transactions table using SQLite 
2.Inserted sample sales data programmatically using pandas 
3.Ensured clean schema with proper data types for analysis,This step helped me simulate a real-world scenario where data is stored in a relational database before analysis begins.

The query results are printed directly in the terminal, making it easy to validate outputs before moving to visualization.

Using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, I performed exploratory analysis on the queried data and created a consolidated EDA dashboard.

This task helped me understand how SQL and Python work together in a real analytics workflow. Writing queries was only one part of the process — validating results, visualizing trends, and interpreting patterns were equally important. 
It also reinforced the importance of clean data preparation before jumping into analysis.
